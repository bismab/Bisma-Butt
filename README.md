[Exploring Lending Club Data & Predicting Scores via Logistic Regression](https://github.com/bismab/LendingClub_Expl_LogReg/blob/master/Term%20Project%20v.13%20(Tuning%20with%20%26%20without%20RFE)%20Grid%20Search.ipynb)

[CO2 Pattern Analysis - 5 Most Populated US States]
(https://github.com/bismab/co2-pattern-analysis-5states/blob/master/Python%20-%20Data%20Cleaning%20-%20Term%20Project%20v2.ipynb)
This analysis will explore the temperature increase trends and compare them to emission patterns for the five most populated states in the USA; California, Texas, New York, Illinois and Florida.

Two separate time-series datasets were used for the purpose of the project. The first dataset, “GlobalLandTemperaturesByState.csv” or DS1 (Appendix A), consisted of average monthly temperatures dated from 1855 to 2013 from states across the globe. The second dataset, “CO2 Emissions by State.csv” or DS2 (Appendix A), consisted of total emissions by type, average carbon footprint per person and total population, dated from 1960 to 2001.
